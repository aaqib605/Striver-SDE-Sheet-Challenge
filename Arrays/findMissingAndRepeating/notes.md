# Problem: Find Missing and Repeating Elements

## Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers with length n, where the elements are in the range from 1 to n, one element is missing from the array, and one element appears twice in the array. You need to find the missing and repeating elements.

**Example:**
Input: [2, 3, 1, 5, 5]
Output: Missing element: 4, Repeating element: 5

## Intuition:

To solve this problem, we can use an auxiliary array to keep track of the frequency of each element. By counting the frequency of each element, we can identify the missing and repeating elements.

## Approach:

1. Create an auxiliary array of size n+1 and initialize all elements to 0.
2. Iterate over the input array and increment the corresponding element in the auxiliary array for each element in the input array.
3. Iterate over the auxiliary array from index 1 to n:
   - If an element has a frequency of 0, it means that element is missing.
   - If an element has a frequency of 2, it means that element is repeating.
4. Return the missing and repeating elements as a pair.

## Complexity Analysis:

- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We iterate over the array twice.
- Space complexity: O(n), as we create an auxiliary array of size n+1 to store the frequencies of the elements.
